# Black Friday Exercise

Copy the notebook located at '/black-friday/answers/AI Platform.ipynb' to the notebooks folder.
Run through the cells to create a random forest model to predict a category type given a customer's previous Black Friday purchasing behavior.

On the Google Cloud Platform, you can run it locally, meaning in your persistent, but small, terminal environment, or on the AI Platform.

The notebook also shows you how to package the resulting model into gzipped file that you can then load onto AI Platform to serve and make dynamic predictions.
