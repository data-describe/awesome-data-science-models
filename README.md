# Awesome Data Science Models

The goal of these projects is to provide tutorials (and answers) of our most popular models we use for training.

They all use [data‚é∞describe](https://github.com/data-describe/data-describe) our open source accelerator for EDA.

| 102 | Beatles Like Predictor | Predict who likes the Beatles   using purely GCP AutoML Tables | Citizen Data Scientists |
| 201 | Lending Club bad-loan | predict if a loan applicant is   high risk using XGBoost and hyper-parameter training. | Data Scientists, Data Engineers |
| 301 | Census Income | The census income example is a   logistic regression model used to demonstrate Google Cloud Platform's AI   Platform.  | Data Scientists, Data Engineers |
| 202 | Taxi Cab Prediction | A wide and deep neural net   implemented using Tensorflow predict trip duration for Chicago taxi rides. | Data Scientists, Data Engineers |

## install instructions

These examples are meant to run on GCP AI Platform. They may very well run elsewhere but we haven't tested.


Create an instance for AI Platform notebooks:

1. Choose Tensorflow Enterprise 2.1 (No GPUs)
    - Make sure you have 4 CPUs and at least 15 GB of memory
    - Click Open JupyterLab
    - Use the Launcher (right-hand-side of screen) to open a Terminal...
2. Install data describe:
     - pip install data-describe[all]
     - pip install xgboost==0.82
     - pip install pandas_gbq
     - pip install google-cloud-bigquery
     - pip install google-cloud-storage



Clone the examples:
```
git clone https://github.com/data-describe/awesome-data-science-models.git
```
